# File2Image Encode

Takes any file and converts its binary data into hex and again into pixel values, creating an image representation of the file.
Pixel-Values are generated by taking 3 bytes (2 digits) of the hex string and concatenate them to a 6-digit hex value which represents a color. This color is then used to create a pixel in the image.

This tool is for now just a fun project but contributions are welcome.
