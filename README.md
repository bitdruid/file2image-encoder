# File2Image Encode

File2Image-Encode is a simple tool that allows you to encode files into images. It takes any file and converts its binary data into base64 and again into pixel values, creating an image representation of the file.

This tool is for now just a fun project but contributions are welcome.

# example

See `test.txt` as encoded image `decoded.png`.

# packages

- `Pillow` for image manipulation
